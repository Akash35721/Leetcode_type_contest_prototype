actually this is just a proof of concept where people can have showdown or a match 

for now its wellwell which is correct answer not the test cases we all know 

// how to run it 

make a virtual env 
activate it 
install dependencies 

for Windows : 
in cmd : (ipconfig)
for linux : ifconfig

under that see the ipv4 : which will look like  192.168.0.106

so ask your friends to connect to http://192.168.0.106:5000  // <<== check your wifi ipv4 this is imortant 

so as already told wellwell is teh correct answer for now until i develop it further 

  THIS IS REALTIME as soon as theres a winner all the others are timed out and cant submit their response (actually heres the backbone make a learderboard out of it or whatever you like ) 


:) (: Happy coding
